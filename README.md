# Sparse hypernetworks for multitasking
Experimentation on multitasking hypernetworks and implementation of sparse hypernetworks.

## Context
Master's thesis on sparse hypernetworks for multitasking completed in order to obtain the degree of Master of Science in Computer Science Engineering (University of Li√®ge, academic year 2021-2022).

## Content

[`hypernetworks/`](hypernetworks/) contains the implementation of sparse hypernetworks as well as chunked hypernetworks.

[`data/`](data/) contains the multitasking datasets: split MNIST, split CIFAR 100, split CIFAR 10 and permute MNIST.

[`models/`](models/) contains the implementation of deep learning computer vision models and expert models.

[`train/`](train/) contains the main trainer

[`train_any.py`](train_any.py) is a script that can run the main experiments performed in this master's thesis.
